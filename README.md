# SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains the notebooks used for the SC1015 mini project. In
this project we aim to understand what determines a good/bad player in Call
of Duty Modern Warfare, a popular first-person shooter (fps) game released
in 2019. We have used the [Call of Duty Players Skills](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aishahakami/call-of-duty-players)
dataset from Kaggle.

## Contributions

## Problem Definition

- How might we cluster players into different "skill tiers" using metrics
  like one's kill-death ratio and win rate?
- What is the best model to classify players into these "skill tiers"
  using predictors like one's level and total playtime.
